# Student-Stress-Monitoring-Analysis
A data analysis project focused on student stress. This repository showcases skills in Excel for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visualizations to uncover key patterns and factors affecting student well-being
Student Stress Monitoring Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of a student stress monitoring dataset. The goal of this analysis was to clean, process, and visualize the data to identify key trends, patterns, and potential factors influencing student stress levels. The entire analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel.

Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains various self-reported metrics from students, including demographic information, physiological data, and responses related to their academic and personal lives. The key variables analyzed in this project include:

Age

Anxiety Levels

Stress Levels

Gender

Analysis and Key Findings
The analysis was performed in a multi-step process, focusing on data preparation, descriptive statistics, and visualization.

Data Cleaning: The initial dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and a key categorical variable (gender) was converted from numerical form (0s and 1s) to a text-based format ("Male," "Female") for clearer analysis and visualization.

Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics, including the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles, were calculated for the primary numerical variables. This step identified a notable outlier in the age variable, which was documented.

Visualizations: Three different charts were created to visually represent the data and key findings:

A Histogram to show the distribution of stress levels across the student population.

A Box & Whisker Plot to analyze the distribution and identify outliers for variables such as anxiety levels.

A Bar Chart to compare the average stress levels between genders.

The findings from this analysis provide insights into student well-being and highlight areas for potential further research.
